<div class="entry-content"><p>So this morning I ended up pointed to the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> project <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kirby/this-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory">This is Not a Conspiracy Theory</a>. I have a plan to do a project soon, so on my list was to look at a range of projects to see how to make ours more likely to be funded.  Just to look at the community in general, the types of projects, how people pitch them and if I saw anything else that might be helpful. So I decided this morning was as good a time as any to do this and I began looking and also decide to back projects that I thought were interesting. I&#8217;ve backed a Kickstarter project in the past, but it didn&#8217;t end up getting the necessary pledges to be funded.</p>

<p>So the first project I funded was the one that brought me to Kickstarter on this particular day. I&#8217;m not sure if I would have had I just come upon the project on its own, but I had just watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/36881035">Everything is a Remix Part 4</a> and wanted to see another project from <a href="http://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson">Kirby Ferguson</a>.</p>

<p>Then I proceeded to go through other projects helping or not just based on my personal impression. Below are the projects I contributed to in order.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/givemesexjesus/jesus-dont-let-me-die-before-ive-had-sex?ref=email">Jesus, Don&#8217;t Let Me Die Before I&#8217;ve Had Sex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christiania/christiania-40-years-of-occupation">CHRISTIANIA - 40 Years of Occupation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kylehenry/fourplay">FOURPLAY</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731609469/more-chilean-than-beans">More Chilean Than Beans</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lensdatecase/contact-lens-case-of-21st-century?">Contact lens case for the 21st Century</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1641885405/healthy-fast-food-revolution-the-beet-box?ref=email">Health Fast-Food Revolution: The Beet Box</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I know this seems like an odd assortment, but it does fit in with my interests.  The intersections of sex, culture and religion has aways interested me.  For example the last book I read was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-InshAllah-Secret-American-Muslim/dp/1593764286">Love, InshAllah</a> which is about the lives and relationships of U.S. American Muslim women. I view <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/givemesexjesus/jesus-dont-let-me-die-before-ive-had-sex?ref=email">Jesus, Don&#8217;t Let Me Die Before I&#8217;ve Had Sex</a> as a different religion and background, but still roughly similar topic.  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kylehenry/fourplay">FOURPLAY</a> is another look into human sexuality, not exactly the same topic but I thought it would be interesting. Also I liked that it was very near getting funded, so I felt like I was really contributing to the project making it.</p>

<p>I backed <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christiania/christiania-40-years-of-occupation">CHRISTIANIA - 40 Years of Occupation</a> mostly because their video was compelling and made me want to watch more of this.  The project was a documentary about Christiania which is an area in Copenhagen that started as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania">squatted military area in 1971</a>. Previously the Danish government mostly let it exist autonomously, but there have been clashes between government and residents in recent years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731609469/more-chilean-than-beans">More Chilean Than Beans</a> is a project to create a documentary about Zandy Mangold, who plans to run a ultramarathon in the Atacama Desert.  Ultra-type events are something I don&#8217;t see myself every attempting, but I&#8217;m interested in the mind-set of people that do complete them.  I did support in 2005 for <a href="http://www.the508.com/">the Furnace Creek 508</a> because I was interested to see the individuals that would do it.</p>

<p>As for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lensdatecase/contact-lens-case-of-21st-century?">Contact lens case for the 21st Century</a> or <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1641885405/healthy-fast-food-revolution-the-beet-box?ref=email">Health Fast-Food Revolution: The Beet Box</a>?  Those were kind of larks at the end of my looking through projects.  The contact lens case I funded enough to get two of them, I thought they were something my sister and mother would like.  The Beet Box?  Well, I think beets are the greatest vegetable ever and I enjoyed how in the team&#8217;s video they bit into a bunch of beets throughout it.</p>

<p>There were many projects I decided not to back, proof by the fact that I&#8217;m not broke now. This was for a variety of reasons. Of course the top reason was the project didn&#8217;t interest me. One of the other main ones was the project didn&#8217;t have a video.  I realize making a video is probably easier for the projets that are documentaries, but even a not particularly well produced video shows commitment and more about the project.  There were of course the projects where they just didn&#8217;t win over my heart, maybe the idea was sound but I just didn&#8217;t feel I should put my dollars behind it. That is the beauty of Kickstarter though, people can fund any of the projects that they are interested in for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Or as in Portlandia spoof, just to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=45_iqB4RO34">help your daughter with her project</a>.</p>
