    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I was reminded the other day of a story from back when I worked at ChoicePoint. Like most places ChoicePoint had its problems, but was an okay place to work most of the time.  Then it was a company of 5,000 people and everyone really ended up in there own little work cliques based on interests or job function.  My clique at work as mostly comprised of the technical people that worked on iMapData and/or those that played sports.  The gender was pretty well mixed there.  I usually judge that at a company by how often when I'm in a meeting of 5-10 people that I'm the only woman in the room.  It was very rare there.</p>

<p>There were different groups you could participate in that were part of the vision of becoming rated one of the best places to work.  One of these was a women's professional group (the actual name is escaping me at the moment).  Honestly I only began going to the group because they provided lunch and I wanted to see who else went.  Most of the women there were from different functions within the company, most where not technical.  I kept attending, because I thought it was good to meet people who worked in other areas and the speakers were interesting sometimes.  There was one incident where I decided not to anymore though.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_A._DiBattiste">Carol DiBattiste</a> who was the Chief Privacy Officer at the time was speaking, I was interesting in seeing what she had to say. Carol had an interesting career before ChoicePoint, including serving United States Under Secretary of the Air Force and Deputy Administrator of the TSA.  This talk occurred at least five years ago and I'm fuzzy on most of the details, but I was intrigued to listen to her talk about the decisions she had made and the people she had as bosses.  What I remember most about the talk though is one of the women asked Carol DiBattiste if she was married, she replied something along the lines of "no, that hasn't happened in my life yet."  I didn't think too much of this at that moment, but what happened at the end of the talk made me think about it.</p>

<p>After the session had broken up and people began to leave I was walking behind two women that worked as administrative assistants.  They were talking about what they had heard, but mostly it was about Carol not being married.  The conversation went like this, "It must be hard for her to find a man who is more successful than her" and then the other woman replied, "Well, she shouldn't worry. She'll find a man someday."  It seemed to me that all that these ladies had gotten out of the talk was that being successful would make it hard to get married.  Nothing about the interesting experiences and opportunities it allows.</p>

<p>After that I never returned to the women's group.  As someone who normally spent time with the technologists and geeks both at work and socially I didn't have that much in common with them. Still to this day I am reminded of that women's group when the topic of sexism in the workplace comes up.  I can't say that this was the most sexist thing I heard or experienced during my employment at ChoicePoint.  There were more of the typical incidents as well, such as when I found an interesting exploit in our web application.  The response from one of the men I showed it to was, "did you husband do that?"  Though I don't think about that as much, I think more about I wonder what became of those two women.</p>
