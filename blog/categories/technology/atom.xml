    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>First I must preface, no I am not a teenager. Yes, I did spent $80 on SMS last month.</em></p>

<p>I've become quite used to using SMS for Twitter.  This habit came out of traveling places where the data connection wasn't good or on occasion non-existant.  One time last year it even saved a friend from a travel issue. <a href="http://rrbaker.com/">Rob Baker</a> was joining our team in Indonesia and we were already out in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bau-Bau">Bau-Bau</a>. I told Rob if he ran into any issues that there was free Wifi at the Makassar Airport and he could always direct message me on Twitter. I told him this ahead of time because I was unsure if I would have a data connection in Bau-Bau. It was fortunate I did because there was no connection and the Wifi at the hotel of our training was broken.</p>

<p>As Indonesian airlines are prone to do his flight to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makassar">Makassar</a> arrived late and he missed the flight to Bau-Bau, the tickets on the two flights were different airlines so the second airline would not honor the ticket at a later time.  Most of the Indonesian airlines don't take U.S. credit cards so Rob was not able to purchase another ticket.  Freaking out a little bit he sent me a message (perhaps I should dedicate another post to the confusion caused by coming to a country where the exchange rate is 9000 rupiah to 1 U.S. Dollar). Fortunately by messaging me on Twitter one of my colleagues was able to book Rob a new ticket and send him on his merry way.</p>

<p>Now Twitter wasn't 100% necessary in this case, I would have eventually gotten an email. Rob could have probably found a way to call me on my Indonesian mobile. What was great though is those things weren't necessary.  I was able to quickly get a message and help Rob, with minimal pain on either of our sides (minus the missed flight airline fiasco of course).</p>

<h2>Whoa, SMS is Expensive</h2>

<p>Previously I have written about <a href="http://wonderchook.com/2011/11/pay-as-you-go/">switching to a prepaid mobile phone plan</a> for when I am in the United States. I decided to attempt not using mobile data while in the U.S. with this plan and see what happened.  The one communications I was not going to give up though was Twitter, so I set my account to use SMS a couple days upon my return to the U.S. This happened to be in the evening so I set it up and then went to bed. The next morning I woke up and my phone was out of credit.  I quickly realized the issue, I had not just set SMS for @ replies and DMs (in other words messages directly to me). There were some friends where I had subscribed to their status updates. This burned through about $20 in one night. I readjusted my settings and purchased credit again see below my spending with T-Mobile over the past 3 months (this incident was 2/6/2012). You'll see however less than two weeks later even with adjusted settings I had burned through what I had bought.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>11/15/2012 $50.00</p></li>
<li><p>2/06/2012 $30.00</p></li>
<li><p>2/14/2012 $50.00</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Paying to Receive</h2>

<p>Text messages to me have always either been unlimited or extremely cheap. When I had a monthly plan previously I had unlimited, in Indonesia they are very cheap and there is no cost of receiving. The no cost to receive is the big thing that changes how one consumes. It is easy to sign-up for alerts or receive unnecessary messages when their is no cost.</p>

<p>In the United States however you pay both to send and receive texts. This can lead to very different mobile usage, such as friends who refuse to use text or status messages such as "On my new phone plan texts cost me money, please IM me."</p>

<p>No perhaps I just have the wrong plan for my consumption. I almost never talk on the phone and when I do it is to call into a meeting, so I end up using Google Voice or Skype for that. If I receive a phone call to my mobile I usually let it go to voicemail unless I'm expecting it. It certainly is weird though to switch from the U.S. where my consumption patterns are apparently not the norm to Indonesia where if you send someone an important email you also text them asking them to read it.</p>

<h2>Will I Live without Twitter?</h2>

<p>Considering I spent $80 in February on Mobile to Tweet and SMS my friends it seems a bit excessive to use Twitter over SMS. I could probably get a data plan for less than that. Or I could stop using Twitter to my phone. I'm still saving money over having a mobile plan that I didn't use for months at a time, but the cost if I stayed in the U.S. for any prolonged period of time would be far too much.</p>

<p>A quick search after the initial publishing of this post showed me that I just need to switch from "Pay As You Go" to "<a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/pay-by-the-day-cell-phone-plans">Pay By The Day</a>" with T-Mobile. My maximum expenditure per month would be $31 plus probably a few minutes at 10 cents a minute if something was urgent.  Far better than the $80 I spent in February.</p>

    <link href="http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2012/02/21/pay-what-you-want-for-peer-help/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-21T04:14:03+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2012/02/21/pay-what-you-want-for-peer-help</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So previously I've read about restaurants switching to models of "pay what you want." For example <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/us/21free.html">Panera Bread tried that model in 2010 in Missouri</a>. Checking back in 2011 it <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-05-16-panera-pay-what-you-can_n.htm">appears to still be going strong</a>. Though the model hasn't worked when applied to a Panera Bread in Portland, Oregon.  There <a href="http://consumerist.com/2011/09/why-paneras-pay-what-you-can-restaurant-didnt-work-in-portland.html">people ended up not paying, but also staying in the restaurant for many hours</a>. <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a> an economics professor <a href="http://www.salon.com/2010/06/17/pay_what_you_can_restaurants/">suggests that this method is unlikely to work for very many restaurant, especially if the method ceases to be a novelty</a>.</p>

<h2>Can This Model Work for Peer to Peer Consulting?</h2>

<p>I would like to experiment with this model for peer to peer consulting. I've considered this for sometime, but in the past I have no had enough control over my time to really try it. Technologists often help each other out, be it through online forums, twitter, direct communication or through publishing knowledge to blogs or source-code repositories. There are sometimes those problems though that are too complex or too specific perhaps to depend on these methods.</p>

<p>There have been times where I have been stuck on a problem and would have been overjoyed to have someone with expertise in that subject be able to sit down for a hour and help.  In these cases sometimes I felt it was asking too much for someone to assist with what I was stuck. Also there have been cases in the past where people maybe wanted me to teach them something and either time didn't allow or they were afraid to ask. This experiment is an attempt to eliminate this embarrassment.</p>

<h2>The Experiment</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I will publish office hours a week in advance</p></li>
<li><p>You can go sign-up for slots, including a description and how I will contact you. I'm open to any means of communication as long as they are free.</p></li>
<li><p>At the slotted time we will begin working on your problem. If it is a problem where it is be worked on asynchronously then I will work on it during the time-slot. If it is something that more requires discussion it will occur during the reserved time.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are satisfied with the help and would like to pay for it then you can pay me through Paypal, send me a gift, trade anything that seems appropriate to you.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Are You Not Going to Help Informally Anymore?</h2>

<p>No don't worry about that. Nothing is going to change in my interactions within the <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> Community, the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>, <a href="http://crisismappers.net/">CrisisMappers</a> or any other place that I am active. This is simply a new method to get my assistance.</p>

<h2>What Might Topics Can You Help?</h2>

<p>I am the type of person that has varied interests, so I have held many types of jobs in the arena of mapping for the past ten years. Below are some items I am qualified for assisting.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Geographic Data Analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Introduction to Programming in Ruby or JavaScript</p></li>
<li><p>Learning How to Get Started with OpenStreetMap</p></li>
<li><p>Basics of using a Linux/Unix based operating system</p></li>
<li><p>Using OpenStreetMap for humanitarian purposes</p></li>
<li><p>Setting Up a Non-profit Organization (basic process in DC)</p></li>
<li><p>Creating Presentations</p></li>
<li><p>Social Media Usage (I only put this for the people that really, really don't get Twitter. But you probably aren't reading my blog if that is the case)</p></li>
<li><p>Creating Data Collection Strategies</p></li>
<li><p>Writing Software Requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a Technical Resume</p></li>
<li><p>Online Technical Community Management</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Maybe you know me well and there is a topic I don't even know someone would want my expertise.</p>

<h2>How to Try It</h2>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUNpSnV1b2VNVWQ4fGRlZmF1bHR8M2Q1YTQ4MWI5OWQzZTVlZjA4NzRjNjYzZDAyZmNmYTc">appointment slots available in my calendar</a> (you may have to sign in with Google, if there is a better solution please let me know in the comments). Please don't forget to include a description of why you are making the appointment and how you would like me to contact you.</p>

<p>So it begins, I'll be Tweeting about my experiences with this under #pwyw,if you use this service or start your own you should too!</p>

    <link href="http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2012/02/17/a-morning-of-funding-on-kickstarter/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-17T17:26:42+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2012/02/17/a-morning-of-funding-on-kickstarter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So this morning I ended up pointed to the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> project <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kirby/this-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory">This is Not a Conspiracy Theory</a>. I have a plan to do a project soon, so on my list was to look at a range of projects to see how to make ours more likely to be funded.  Just to look at the community in general, the types of projects, how people pitch them and if I saw anything else that might be helpful. So I decided this morning was as good a time as any to do this and I began looking and also decide to back projects that I thought were interesting. I've backed a Kickstarter project in the past, but it didn't end up getting the necessary pledges to be funded.</p>

<p>So the first project I funded was the one that brought me to Kickstarter on this particular day. I'm not sure if I would have had I just come upon the project on its own, but I had just watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/36881035">Everything is a Remix Part 4</a> and wanted to see another project from <a href="http://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson">Kirby Ferguson</a>.</p>

<p>Then I proceeded to go through other projects helping or not just based on my personal impression. Below are the projects I contributed to in order.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/givemesexjesus/jesus-dont-let-me-die-before-ive-had-sex?ref=email">Jesus, Don't Let Me Die Before I've Had Sex</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christiania/christiania-40-years-of-occupation">CHRISTIANIA - 40 Years of Occupation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kylehenry/fourplay">FOURPLAY</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731609469/more-chilean-than-beans">More Chilean Than Beans</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lensdatecase/contact-lens-case-of-21st-century?">Contact lens case for the 21st Century</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1641885405/healthy-fast-food-revolution-the-beet-box?ref=email">Health Fast-Food Revolution: The Beet Box</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>I know this seems like an odd assortment, but it does fit in with my interests.  The intersections of sex, culture and religion has aways interested me.  For example the last book I read was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-InshAllah-Secret-American-Muslim/dp/1593764286">Love, InshAllah</a> which is about the lives and relationships of U.S. American Muslim women. I view <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/givemesexjesus/jesus-dont-let-me-die-before-ive-had-sex?ref=email">Jesus, Don't Let Me Die Before I've Had Sex</a> as a different religion and background, but still roughly similar topic.  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kylehenry/fourplay">FOURPLAY</a> is another look into human sexuality, not exactly the same topic but I thought it would be interesting. Also I liked that it was very near getting funded, so I felt like I was really contributing to the project making it.</p>

<p>I backed <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christiania/christiania-40-years-of-occupation">CHRISTIANIA - 40 Years of Occupation</a> mostly because their video was compelling and made me want to watch more of this.  The project was a documentary about Christiania which is an area in Copenhagen that started as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania">squatted military area in 1971</a>. Previously the Danish government mostly let it exist autonomously, but there have been clashes between government and residents in recent years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731609469/more-chilean-than-beans">More Chilean Than Beans</a> is a project to create a documentary about Zandy Mangold, who plans to run a ultramarathon in the Atacama Desert.  Ultra-type events are something I don't see myself every attempting, but I'm interested in the mind-set of people that do complete them.  I did support in 2005 for <a href="http://www.the508.com/">the Furnace Creek 508</a> because I was interested to see the individuals that would do it.</p>

<p>As for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lensdatecase/contact-lens-case-of-21st-century?">Contact lens case for the 21st Century</a> or <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1641885405/healthy-fast-food-revolution-the-beet-box?ref=email">Health Fast-Food Revolution: The Beet Box</a>?  Those were kind of larks at the end of my looking through projects.  The contact lens case I funded enough to get two of them, I thought they were something my sister and mother would like.  The Beet Box?  Well, I think beets are the greatest vegetable ever and I enjoyed how in the team's video they bit into a bunch of beets throughout it.</p>

<p>There were many projects I decided not to back, proof by the fact that I'm not broke now. This was for a variety of reasons. Of course the top reason was the project didn't interest me. One of the other main ones was the project didn't have a video.  I realize making a video is probably easier for the projets that are documentaries, but even a not particularly well produced video shows commitment and more about the project.  There were of course the projects where they just didn't win over my heart, maybe the idea was sound but I just didn't feel I should put my dollars behind it. That is the beauty of Kickstarter though, people can fund any of the projects that they are interested in for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Or as in Portlandia spoof, just to help your daughter with her project.</p>

    <id>http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2011/11/12/joined-geekeasy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi should have probably posted this before I left DC, since the next-time I'll be able to use it is early 2012.  I joined as a drop <a href="http://www.geekeasy.org/">GeekEasy</a>, GeekEasy is a new coworking space in NW DC near the corner of 14th and Florida.</p>

<p>For those that aren't familiar with the idea, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking">coworking</a> is getting together somewhere with likeminded people.  This is to simulate an office working environment.  Or at least the parts of it you miss when you work remotely all the time.  There are different types of facilities, some are generic, some focused around start-ups, some focused at technical people, others aimed at social enterprise.  GeekEasy is specifically aimed at geeks, my life-long friend <a href="http://xiann.com/">Christiann</a> was the first to join and that is what got me over there.  She and I work together in other locations, but sometimes a change of scenery can be really helpful.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you are in DC and need somewhere to go and work you should check it out.  Maybe I'll see you there sometime in 2012!</p>

    <link href="http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2011/11/05/pay-as-you-go/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-05T03:51:05+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://wonderchook.github.com/blog/2011/11/05/pay-as-you-go</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So by the end of 2011 I will have spent roughly 1/2 my time the year outside of the United States.  Paying monthly for Verizon is seeming unnecessary for me.  I don't talk on the phone very much and I've gotten used to slow Internet access on my phone often when I'm abroad. I began investigating ways to save money on my phone and researched pay as you go plans.  My requirements were that I had to be able to buy a SIM Card (no CDMA networks) and it had to be cheaper than what I was paying monthly.</p>

<p>So finally I decided on T-Mobile and ordered a SIM card.  I paid for overnight shipping so the total was $19.40.  Not too bad, though if I had gone to a store I could have saved the $11.00 in shipping costs, but T-Mobile said they couldn't process my order.  Why they have to background check me for a prepaid card I don't know.  I suppose to make sure I'm not a drug-dealer or something.  So I ended up going to a store and purchasing a SIM card for 6.99 + Tax and a $50.00 credit.</p>

<p>So next up porting my old number to Google Voice.  I decided this was the easiest thing to do because then I wouldn't have to notify anyone of a new number AND when I'm abroad people can contact me like they would at home.  The first step was to get into my Verizon account and find out my account number.  I had not reset my password to Verizon's website in about a year and just paid the bill from my phone. When I finally looked into my Mobile expenses it turns out I was paying $161.57 a month! Though I did have a Mifi and a phone (yes, the above revelation shows something about my personal bookkeeping).  Anyway then I went through the process with Google Voice to port my mobile number.  When it says you may have a disruption in receiving calls and texts for up to three days they mean it.  Much hilarity ensued when I texted people and never received their response.  This was combined with the fact that I didn't have a phone that would work with my new SIM card at the time.  Anyway, none of the mishaps were the end of the world and it was a good reminder of how dependent we can be on technology.</p>

<p>So now that I'm all set-up to pay as I go, I'm off on another trip abroad.</p>
