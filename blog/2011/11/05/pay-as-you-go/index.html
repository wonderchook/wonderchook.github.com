<div class="entry-content"><p>So by the end of 2011 I will have spent roughly 1/2 my time the year outside of the United States.  Paying monthly for Verizon is seeming unnecessary for me.  I don&#8217;t talk on the phone very much and I&#8217;ve gotten used to slow Internet access on my phone often when I&#8217;m abroad. I began investigating ways to save money on my phone and researched pay as you go plans.  My requirements were that I had to be able to buy a SIM Card (no CDMA networks) and it had to be cheaper than what I was paying monthly.</p>

<p>So finally I decided on T-Mobile and ordered a SIM card.  I paid for overnight shipping so the total was $19.40.  Not too bad, though if I had gone to a store I could have saved the $11.00 in shipping costs, but T-Mobile said they couldn&#8217;t process my order.  Why they have to background check me for a prepaid card I don&#8217;t know.  I suppose to make sure I&#8217;m not a drug-dealer or something.  So I ended up going to a store and purchasing a SIM card for 6.99 + Tax and a $50.00 credit.</p>

<p>So next up porting my old number to Google Voice.  I decided this was the easiest thing to do because then I wouldn&#8217;t have to notify anyone of a new number AND when I&#8217;m abroad people can contact me like they would at home.  The first step was to get into my Verizon account and find out my account number.  I had not reset my password to Verizon&#8217;s website in about a year and just paid the bill from my phone. When I finally looked into my Mobile expenses it turns out I was paying $161.57 a month! Though I did have a Mifi and a phone (yes, the above revelation shows something about my personal bookkeeping).  Anyway then I went through the process with Google Voice to port my mobile number.  When it says you may have a disruption in receiving calls and texts for up to three days they mean it.  Much hilarity ensued when I texted people and never received their response.  This was combined with the fact that I didn&#8217;t have a phone that would work with my new SIM card at the time.  Anyway, none of the mishaps were the end of the world and it was a good reminder of how dependent we can be on technology.</p>

<p>So now that I&#8217;m all set-up to pay as I go, I&#8217;m off on another trip abroad.</p>
